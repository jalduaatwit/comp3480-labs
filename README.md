# COMP3480 Labs

This repository contains programming lab assignments for COMP3480, focusing on building web services with increasing complexity and features, progressing from FastAPI (Python) to Express.js (Node.js).

## Labs

### [Lab 1 - Introduction](Lab%201/README.md)
Basic FastAPI service with 10 endpoints covering fundamental concepts like path parameters, query strings, and POST requests.

### [Lab 2 - Advanced FastAPI Service](Lab%202/README.md)
Advanced FastAPI service with 12 endpoints, including header authentication, cookie handling, and an interactive CLI testing tool.

### [Lab 3 - Express.js Service](Lab%203/README.md)
Express.js web service with 11 endpoints, demonstrating the transition from Python/FastAPI to JavaScript/Node.js with mixed HTML and JSON responses.

## Getting Started

Each lab folder contains its own README with detailed instructions on how to run and test the code.
