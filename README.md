# COMP3480 Labs

This repository contains programming lab assignments for COMP3480, focusing on building web services with increasing complexity and features, progressing from FastAPI (Python) to Express.js (Node.js), containerization with Docker, and SQL database operations.

## Labs

### [Lab 1 - Introduction](Lab%201/README.md)
Basic FastAPI service with 10 endpoints covering fundamental concepts like path parameters, query strings, and POST requests.

### [Lab 2 - Advanced FastAPI Service](Lab%202/README.md)
Advanced FastAPI service with 12 endpoints, including header authentication, cookie handling, and an interactive CLI testing tool.

### [Lab 3 - Express.js Service](Lab%203/README.md)
Express.js web service with 11 endpoints, demonstrating the transition from Python/FastAPI to JavaScript/Node.js with mixed HTML and JSON responses.

### [Lab 4 - Docker Containerization](Lab%204/README.md)
Docker containerization of the FastAPI service, focusing on container building and deployment.

### [Lab 5 - SQL Database Queries](Lab%205/README.md)
SQL database operations with 13 queries covering simple queries, inner joins, and aggregation functions using a guitar shop database.

### [Lab 6 - Containerized MySQL Database](Lab%206/README.md)
Containerized MySQL database using Docker Compose with 13 SQL queries, demonstrating database deployment and management in a containerized environment.
